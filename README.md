### Ideas
* Use a weather patterns data set and correlating it with food crop productivity in an effort to predict future food shortages based on current weather trends. [Potential weather dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview)
* Evaluate the distribution of crops across continents, perhaps explaining why some countries are richer/healthier/something else related to their crop production.
* Analyze changes in forested land in recent years. In some countries, there has been a big push recently to re-forest dairy and sheep + beef farms to offset carbon. We would be intrigued to see how this has evolved, the trend in other countries trying to lower CO2 emissions, and also the contrast with the many countries where deforestation is still an issue.
* Analyze increases in food production to see if we will be able to meet predicted global demand in the next few decades. Possibly also combining a data set of how much meat/fish/dairy people consume (e.g. look at those trends in the US over time, and extrapolate those trends to other emerging countries probably having them over the next few decades)
* Analyze the vegan trend and meat consumption. For example, we could analyze how interest in vegan lifestyle and decreasing meat consumption has evolved. We could check how this has evolved in parallel to increasing interest in global warming and the impact of meat consumption, for example by using the Wikipedia dataset. 
* Compare increasing interest in vegan lifestyle and see if this is reflected in cooking recipes or grocery shopping. Another idea is to compare it to development in agriculture. We could analyze how demand for vegan food in wealthier countries can put some pressure on agriculture in poorer countries. Thereby underscoring the fact that global market structures and national relations need to similarly and simultaneously undergo a transformation for that change in lifestyle to be sustainable.
