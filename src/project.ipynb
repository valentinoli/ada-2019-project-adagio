    "The first step is to calculate, for each type of food, how much of what is consumed by the Swiss population is produced within Switzerland versus imported. To do this, we will combine 3 sets of data: imports, exports, and domestic production. The imports and exports data are sourced from [Swiss Impex](https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/index.xhtml), a website hosted by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration which provides data on Switzerland's global trade activity. Domestic production data comes from [FAOStat](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which offers a variety of agricultural-related data. In theory, the amount of food consumed in Switzerland (including food waste) can be calculated from these datasets:\n",

Unfortunately, these data conflicted with the data from FAO and Swiss Impex.

More importantly, a report from the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (\"Concentrate Animal Feed as an Input Good in Swiss Agricultural Production - The Effects of Border Protection and Other Support Measures\") claims 90% of animal feed used in Switzerland is domestically produced, drastically reducing the carbon impact of the meat industry in the country. This percentage can be found in [this PDF document](https://www.sbv-usp.ch/fileadmin/sbvuspch/00_Bilder/06_Services/Agristat/Statistiken/Produktionsmittel__Umwelt/SES2018_Kap04_Produktionsmittel-Umwelt.pdf) (see the table on page 8):"

For example, 90% of cow and cattle feed is domestically produced, whereas that number is only 52% for pork and 30% for poultry (found in the Concentrate Animal Feed report above, where it was sourced from the PDF linked above). So even if chickens are less carbon intensive, they require more imported feed which might increase their carbon output!"
