    "The first step is to calculate, for each type of food, how much of what is consumed by the Swiss population is produced within Switzerland versus imported. To do this, we will combine 3 sets of data: imports, exports, and domestic production. The imports and exports data are sourced from [Swiss Impex](https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/index.xhtml), a website hosted by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration which provides data on Switzerland's global trade activity. Domestic production data comes from [FAOStat](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which offers a variety of agricultural-related data. In theory, the amount of food consumed in Switzerland (including food waste) can be calculated from these datasets:\n",

This percentage can be found in [this PDF document](https://www.sbv-usp.ch/fileadmin/sbvuspch/00_Bilder/06_Services/Agristat/Statistiken/Produktionsmittel__Umwelt/SES2018_Kap04_Produktionsmittel-Umwelt.pdf) (see the table on page 8):"
