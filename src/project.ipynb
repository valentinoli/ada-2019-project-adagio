    "The first step is to calculate, for each type of food, how much of what is consumed by the Swiss population is produced within Switzerland versus imported. To do this, we will combine 3 sets of data: imports, exports, and domestic production. The imports and exports data are sourced from [Swiss Impex](https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/index.xhtml), a website hosted by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration which provides data on Switzerland's global trade activity. Domestic production data comes from [FAOStat](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which offers a variety of agricultural-related data. In theory, the amount of food consumed in Switzerland (including food waste) can be calculated from these datasets:\n",

    "Note that the Swiss Federal Statistics Office also provided relevant data--namely, it has a dataset on Swiss food consumption by type of food. Unfortunately, these data conflicted with the data from FAO and Swiss Impex. Since the Federal Statistics Office data was much less detailed (for instance, more general/broad food categories), we decided to focus on Impex and FAO, knowing that the numbers must be taken with a grain of salt since it is difficult to accurately quantify such data.\n",

This percentage can be found in [this PDF document](https://www.sbv-usp.ch/fileadmin/sbvuspch/00_Bilder/06_Services/Agristat/Statistiken/Produktionsmittel__Umwelt/SES2018_Kap04_Produktionsmittel-Umwelt.pdf) (see the table on page 8):"
