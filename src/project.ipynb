    "The first step is to calculate, for each type of food, how much of what is consumed by the Swiss population is produced within Switzerland versus imported. To do this, we will combine 3 sets of data: imports, exports, and domestic production. The imports and exports data are sourced from [Swiss Impex](https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/index.xhtml), a website hosted by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration which provides data on Switzerland's global trade activity. Domestic production data comes from [FAOStat](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which offers a variety of agricultural-related data. In theory, the amount of food consumed in Switzerland (including food waste) can be calculated from these datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Food consumed = domestic production + imports - exports\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Swiss Federal Statistics Office also provided relevant data--namely, it has a dataset on Swiss food consumption by type of food. Unfortunately, these data conflicted with the data from FAO and Swiss Impex. Since the Federal Statistics Office data was much less detailed (for instance, more general/broad food categories), we decided to focus on Impex and FAO, knowing that the numbers must be taken with a grain of salt since it is difficult to accurately quantify such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load all the data and then combine the various data sets to get the values of interest. First we'll load imports and exports data from Impex. The data is spread across multiple Excel files and sheets."

This implicates the sourcing of animal feed as a very important factor for the carbon intensity of these foods. For example, if Switzerland produced most of its meat domestically, but it imported all of its feed, the carbon intensity of its meat would be much higher than if the feed were grown domestically. Thus, both aspects of the final food product must be examined."

Cheese, a category of which there are many different flavors and consumers like variety, is both heavily imported and exported, likely giving consumers access to a wider variety of cheese types.

    "The butter category of this graph is a good transition to the continuation of the analysis; just because butter is hardly imported nor exported does not mean the Swiss do not eat butter! Rather, imports and exports are only part of the broader picture since domestic production is another important consideration. One possible hypothesis for why butter is neither imported nor exported in large quantities is because domestic production is nearly equal to domestic consumption."

    "Now that we have calculated Switzerland's production and consumption, we want to have a look at how this translates in terms of equivalent CO$_2$ production. To do this, we could look at Swiss-specific values for the greenhouse gas production for different food types, however data from other countries is very sparse and reliable data for many food types is only available for certain countries. Later in the analysis, we want to compare Swiss production emissions with Swiss import emissions, therefore for consistency we need to either have data available for all (or most) countries for a given product, or use global averages. Comprehensive data is available on meat and cereal production emissions worldwide, however fruit and vegetable figures are much harder to obtain and only a limited number of studies have been carried out. These studies have been accumulated in a systematic review (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616303584) and these values have been used to calculate averages for a number of different kinds of produce. To ensure our results are consistent, we will use this generalisation of global average values to estimate the domestic Swiss emissions for fruit and vegetables.\n",
