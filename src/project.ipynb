    "The first step is to calculate, for each type of food, how much of what is consumed by the Swiss population is produced within Switzerland versus imported. To do this, we will combine 3 sets of data: imports, exports, and domestic production. The imports and exports data are sourced from [Swiss Impex](https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/index.xhtml), a website hosted by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration which provides data on Switzerland's global trade activity. Domestic production data comes from [FAOStat](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which offers a variety of agricultural-related data. In theory, the amount of food consumed in Switzerland (including food waste) can be calculated from these datasets:\n",

Later in the analysis, we want to compare Swiss production emissions with Swiss import emissions, therefore for consistency we need to either have data available for all (or most) countries for a given product, or use global averages. Comprehensive data is available on meat and cereal production emissions worldwide, however fruit and vegetable figures are much harder to obtain and only a limited number of studies have been carried out. These studies have been accumulated in a systematic review (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616303584) and these values have been used to calculate averages for a number of different kinds of produce.
