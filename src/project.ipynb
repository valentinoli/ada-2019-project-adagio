    "The first step is to calculate, for each type of food, how much of what is consumed by the Swiss population is produced within Switzerland versus imported. To do this, we will combine 3 sets of data: imports, exports, and domestic production. The imports and exports data are sourced from [Swiss Impex](https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/index.xhtml), a website hosted by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration which provides data on Switzerland's global trade activity. Domestic production data comes from [FAOStat](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which offers a variety of agricultural-related data. In theory, the amount of food consumed in Switzerland (including food waste) can be calculated from these datasets:\n",

Unfortunately, these data conflicted with the data from FAO and Swiss Impex.

    "Nearly three-quarters of imported animal feed is imported from nearby countries, which means when Switzerland must import feed, they mostly minimize carbon emissions from the process by reducing the travel distance of the feed. More importantly, a report from the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (\"Concentrate Animal Feed as an Input Good in Swiss Agricultural Production - The Effects of Border Protection and Other Support Measures\") claims 90% of animal feed used in Switzerland is domestically produced, drastically reducing the carbon impact of the meat industry in the country. This percentage can be found in [this PDF document](https://www.sbv-usp.ch/fileadmin/sbvuspch/00_Bilder/06_Services/Agristat/Statistiken/Produktionsmittel__Umwelt/SES2018_Kap04_Produktionsmittel-Umwelt.pdf) (see the table on page 8):"

For example, 90% of cow and cattle feed is domestically produced, whereas that number is only 52% for pork and 30% for poultry (found in the Concentrate Animal Feed report above, where it was sourced from the PDF linked above). So even if chickens are less carbon intensive, they require more imported feed which might increase their carbon output!"

    "Now that we have calculated Switzerland's production and consumption, we want to have a look at how this translates in terms of equivalent CO$_2$ production. To do this, we could look at Swiss-specific values for the greenhouse gas production for different food types, however data from other countries is very sparse and reliable data for many food types is only available for certain countries. Later in the analysis, we want to compare Swiss production emissions with Swiss import emissions, therefore for consistency we need to either have data available for all (or most) countries for a given product, or use global averages. Comprehensive data is available on meat and cereal production emissions worldwide, however fruit and vegetable figures are much harder to obtain and only a limited number of studies have been carried out. These studies have been accumulated in a systematic review (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616303584) and these values have been used to calculate averages for a number of different kinds of produce. To ensure our results are consistent, we will use this generalisation of global average values to estimate the domestic Swiss emissions for fruit and vegetables.\n",

These values, or similar data for other countries worldwide could be used to estimate the transport means for different products and thus the impact this transport has on emissions for each product. Perishable products more frequently have to be transported by air, and therefore have a significantly larger carbon footprint."
