    "The first step is to calculate, for each type of food, how much of what is consumed by the Swiss population is produced within Switzerland versus imported. To do this, we will combine 3 sets of data: imports, exports, and domestic production. The imports and exports data are sourced from [Swiss Impex](https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/index.xhtml), a website hosted by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration which provides data on Switzerland's global trade activity. Domestic production data comes from [FAOStat](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which offers a variety of agricultural-related data. In theory, the amount of food consumed in Switzerland (including food waste) can be calculated from these datasets:\n",

This relies upon assumptions that we made previously (mentioned here). The two categories this data processing can fall into are:\n",

In this case, we will assume that each country's imports are exported in an equal percentage (e.g. if Switzerland imports 100 kg of bananas from Country X and 50 kg of bananas from Country Y, and the deficit between Switzerland's production and its exports is 10 kg, a fixed percentage of bananas from each country will be assumed to be exported while the remainder is consumed in Switzerland). Hence, the fraction of that food item from that country consumed in Switzerland is (the total amount of that food item imported from that country) / (the total imports across all countries for that food item).
