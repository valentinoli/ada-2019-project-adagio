    "As is slowly becoming a widely-known fact, the meat and animal product industry is significantly more carbon-intensive than plant-based foods. The amount of CO2 produced per kg (or even kcal) of meat/animal product is much higher than the amount of CO2 for the same mass/energy equivalent of plants (e.g. fruits, vegetables, legumes). One might think, then, that the best way to reduce one's \"carbon foodprint\" (carbon footprint due to food production) is to take on a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is intriguing is that this may not be the answer in all cases. Based on where food is sourced, what time of year it is grown, and how it is produced, the carbon emissions can change drastically. A hot house tomato grown out of season can produce less carbon than pasture-fed goat meat, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important question that data can answer, then, is how an eco-friendly citizen can best adapt their diet, based on their specific living circumstances, to reduce their carbon foodprint. Here, we will perform an in-depth analysis on Switzerland, providing a consumer with the knowledge necessary to produce less carbon emissions due to their diet. This will include an analysis of carbon intensities by food type and the various types and sources of food that are imported into Switzerland. After all, since Switzerland has a fairly dense population for its small size, it imports a significant amount of its food:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"According to the Federal Agriculture Office, Switzerland’s gross self-sufficiency rate in 2015 was 59%. The degree of self-sufficiency is defined as the ratio of domestic production to total domestic consumption. With imported animal feed taken into account, the net level of self-sufficiency was 51% that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a closer look at the data reveals major differences across products. The country has been able to produce almost 100% of its animal foodstuffs for years, yet has managed only about 40% self-sufficiency for plant-based foods, a rate that fluctuates year on year as harvests are highly weather-dependent.\" (From swissinfo.ch)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on where and what types of food Switzerland is importing its non-meat food products from, this raises the possibility that a Swiss citizen might have a smaller carbon foodprint by eating more meat, contradicting the typical recommendation. Would living with a vegan diet require an excessive amount of imported foods, outweighting the carbon offset of not eating meat? Or is there a large enough amount of imported livestock feed that eating a plant-based diet is still more sustainable? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by looking at Swiss food imports on a macro scale."
